# üéµ Spotify Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Spotify integration for your Beatric app.

## Prerequisites

1. **Spotify Premium Account**: You need a Spotify Premium account for full API access
2. **Spotify App Installed**: Make sure you have the Spotify app installed on your device
3. **Developer Account**: You'll need to create a Spotify Developer account

## Step 1: Create a Spotify App

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Log in with your Spotify account
3. Click "Create App"
4. Fill in the app details:
   - **App name**: `Beatric Workout App`
   - **App description**: `Fitness app with music integration`
   - **Website**: `https://your-website.com` (optional)
   - **Redirect URI**: `exp://192.168.81.71:8081/spotify-auth-callback`
   - **API/SDKs**: Select "Web API"
5. Accept the terms and click "Save"

## Step 2: Get Your Credentials

After creating the app, you'll get:
- **Client ID**: (Your actual client ID from the dashboard)
- **Client Secret**: (Your actual client secret from the dashboard)

## Step 3: Update Configuration

1. Open `src/config/spotify.ts`
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:
   ```typescript
   export const SPOTIFY_CONFIG = {
     CLIENT_ID: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_CLIENT_ID_HERE',        // Replace this
     CLIENT_SECRET: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE', // Replace this
     // ... rest of config
   };
   ```

## Step 4: Add Users to Your App (IMPORTANT!)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Spotify apps in development mode require manual user addition!

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Select your app
3. Go to **"Users"** tab
4. Click **"Add New User"**
5. Enter the **Spotify email address** of users who want to test
6. **Maximum 25 users** allowed in development mode

**Why This is Required:**
- Spotify apps start in **"Development Mode"** by default
- Only added users can authenticate with your app
- This prevents unauthorized access during development
- You must manually add each user who wants to test

**To Remove This Limitation:**
- Submit your app for review to move to **"Production Mode"**
- This allows unlimited users but requires Spotify approval
- Only recommended for production apps

## Step 5: Update Redirect URI

The redirect URI in your Spotify app settings should match:
```
exp://192.168.81.71:8081/spotify-auth-callback
```

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Remove the `--` from the redirect URI
- Use your current IP address: `192.168.81.71`
- The port should match your Expo server (usually 8081)

## Step 5: Test the Integration

1. Start your Expo development server:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --lan
   ```

2. Open the app on your device

3. Navigate to Home ‚Üí "Connect Spotify" or Workout ‚Üí "Connect Spotify"

4. Tap "Connect Spotify" and follow the authentication flow

5. Grant the requested permissions when prompted

## Troubleshooting

### "invalid_client" Error
This error occurs when:
1. **Client ID is incorrect** - Double-check your Spotify app credentials
2. **Client Secret is incorrect** - Verify the secret matches your app
3. **App not properly configured** - Ensure your app is created and active in the dashboard

**To fix:**
1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Select your app
3. Copy the exact Client ID and Client Secret
4. Update `src/config/spotify.ts` with these values
5. Restart your Expo server

### "invalid redirect url" Error
This error occurs when:
1. **IP address changed** - Your computer's IP address may have changed
2. **Port mismatch** - Expo is running on a different port
3. **Redirect URI mismatch** - Spotify dashboard doesn't match your app

**To fix:**
1. Check your current IP: `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac/Linux)
2. Update the redirect URI in Spotify dashboard to match
3. Update the redirect URI in your app if needed
4. Restart Expo server

### Authentication Keeps Loading
This usually means:
1. **Redirect URI mismatch** - The callback isn't working properly
2. **Network issues** - Check your internet connection
3. **App permissions** - Ensure you granted all requested permissions

### Pause Button Restarts Song
This issue occurs when:
1. **State synchronization problem** - Local state doesn't match Spotify state
2. **Network delay** - Spotify API response takes time to reflect

**To fix:**
1. **Restart the app** - This refreshes the state
2. **Check Spotify app** - Ensure it's not playing on another device
3. **Wait a moment** - Sometimes there's a delay in state updates
4. **Use Spotify app directly** - For immediate control

**Note**: This is a known issue with Spotify Web API integration and has been fixed in the latest version of the app.

   - Check for extra spaces or typos

2. **"Authentication failed" error**
   - Verify your Client ID and Client Secret are correct
   - Make sure you're using a Spotify Premium account

3. **"No active device" error**
   - Open the Spotify app on your device
   - Make sure you're logged in
   - Try playing a song in Spotify first

4. **"Permission denied" error**
   - Check that you granted all requested permissions
   - Try disconnecting and reconnecting

### Debug Mode

To enable debug logging, add this to your app:

```typescript
// In your main App.tsx or where you initialize Spotify
if (__DEV__) {
  console.log('Spotify Debug Mode Enabled');
}
```

## Security Notes

- **Never commit your Client Secret** to version control
- Use environment variables for production
- The Client Secret should be kept secure on your backend

## Production Setup

For production deployment:

1. Create a separate Spotify app for production
2. Use environment variables for credentials
3. Update redirect URIs for your production domain
4. Implement proper error handling and retry logic

Be aware of Spotify API rate limits:
- **User Profile**: 25 requests per second
- **Playback Control**: 25 requests per second
